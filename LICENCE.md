# WeatherForecast app

This is an Android app that demonstrates the use of MVVM architecture with Jetpack components. It uses Android SDK 33 as the target version and has a minimum SDK version of 26 to ensure maximum compatibility with a wide range of devices.

The app retrieves data from a REST API using Retrofit for network calls. Dependency injection is achieved with Dagger Hilt.

This is a small-scale app and therefore, we have omitted the creation of use cases.
